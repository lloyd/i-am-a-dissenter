You've got an idea.  You've got early affirmation that you're headed
in the Right Direction.  Now you just need to get some programmer types
to "code it up", right?

Wrong.

You must *start* with a technical giant, someone who "scares the shit
out of you" with their competence, deeply shakes your resolve in this
big idea and why it matters, and then can reflect it back to you in a
way that makes it real.  Simply put, this is someone you're willing to
spend years of your life with - someone you're comfortable having your
success be contingent upon - someone you *enjoy* thinking with.

Still think you can settle for less and just manage more?  I
still disagree - **Your time is precious** and you must spend every
moment building and strenghtening relationships, finding and refining
product-market fit, and *leading*.  Effective technical leadership of
your core team of half a dozen requires daily care and attention.
A bad technolgy choice can cost you weeks - an insensitive explanation
of Why We're Changing Direction can obliterate productivity - and
a bad hire can cause your best people to respond to that google
recruiter.

Ideas are cheap, execution is everything, and your technical leader is
the focal point of your organization.  The one who turns good ideas
into an execution plan that people can actually commit to, 
keeps shit on the rails while you're on the
road, and turns a small group of developers into a resilient and powerful team.

Building a worthwhile product requires exquisite technical leadership,
*get this first*.

Execution is everything.
